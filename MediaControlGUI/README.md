# Media Controls
This project consists of the ported [$1 Recognizer](http://depts.washington.edu/acelab/proj/dollar/index.html) and the main WinForm app.\
Main functionality includes:
- Pausing and skipping to the previous or next track using discrete gestures
- Dragging with two fingers to adjust the system volume
- Setting one of the many available discrete gestures for each action
- Showing you how a discrete gesture is supposed to be drawn and how you drew it
- Being able to record custom discrete gestures and set them as trigger
- Minimizing to system tray so it doesn't get in the way

The recognizer is implemented [here](./Recognizer).
