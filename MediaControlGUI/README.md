# Media Controls
This project consists of the ported [$1 Recognizer](http://depts.washington.edu/acelab/proj/dollar/index.html) and the main WinForm app.\
Main functionality includes:
- Pausing and skipping to the previous or next track using gestures
- Setting one of the many available gestures for each action
- Showing you how a gesture is supposed to be drawn and how you drew it
- Being able to record custom gestures and set them as trigger
- Minimizing to system tray so it doesn't get in the way

For documentation regarding the recognizer, please see [here](./Recognizer).
